Introduction

Observations from the study of biological systems served as the inspiration for the mathematical creation of artificial neural networks which offer a new approach to problems of perception, learning, memory, and reasoning. They infer emergent properties that allow us to solve problems that were considered complex before and prove to be very promising alternatives for circumventing some of the limitations of conventional computers [1]. 

The brain learning process consists of either establishing new connections or modifying existing ones. Based on this concept, we build artificial models of neurons and train them to eventually perform useful functions, even if the networks we develop possess only a tiny fraction of the power of the human brain. Artificial neural networks are not any more similar to real neurons than feathers are to modern airplanes, despite being modeled after the connections between neurons present in biological systems. Although both biological systems—feathers and neurons—have practical uses, the application of the underlying principles has led to the development of artificial inventions that are very different from the biological systems [2].

Neural networks find applications in various fields. Among them, airplane autopilot, car guidance, signal processing systems, speech synthesis and speaker recognition, computer vision and face recognition, forecasting the monetary markets, assessing financial or insurance risk, medical diagnosis, oil and gas exploration, robotics, telecommunications, etc. 

There are different types of neural networks, each performing a specific function, among them, modeling, classification, and control. The most commonly used type of Neural Networks is the multi-layer perceptron.

In this section, we will introduce neurons and their properties, layered neural networks as well as learning algorithms.
