**Introduction**

In this chapter, we present the development of a machine learning model for traffic forecasting in 4G mobile networks. Given the dynamic nature of network traffic, accurate forecasting is essential for optimizing resource allocation and ensuring quality of service. The chosen approach is a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a type of feedforward neural network known for its ability to model nonlinear relationships in time series data. Our objective is to predict the network throughput of the next hour based on the current and previous hours, using a minimal yet effective architecture. This chapter details each stage of the modeling process, from defining the problem and preparing the data to designing the network and evaluating its performance. The focus is on both the practical implementation and the rationale behind the design choices. Through systematic experimentation, we aim to demonstrate the feasibility of using a simple neural architecture for short-term traffic prediction in cellular networks.



**Conclusion**

This chapter has outlined the complete process of building a neural network-based model for traffic forecasting in 4G mobile networks. Starting from the definition of the problem and selection of input-output variables, we proceeded through data preprocessing, network design, and model training. The chosen architecture—a Multilayer Perceptron with a single hidden layer of three neurons—proved effective for capturing short-term dependencies in network throughput. Experimental results demonstrated that even with a minimal structure, the model was able to achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy. Key performance metrics, residual analysis, and evaluation on test data validated the reliability of the approach. While there is room for further optimization, the findings confirm that lightweight machine learning models can offer valuable insights for traffic management in mobile networks. This sets the stage for future work involving more complex architectures or additional contextual features to enhance prediction accuracy.
