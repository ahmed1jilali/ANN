**Synthesis Methodology**

The synthesis of an MLP consists of several well-defined steps. These steps ensure effective learning and generalization of the network:

1. Problem Definition
   
   1.1 Clearly identify the nature of the problem (regression, classification, etc.).
   
   1.2 Define the input and output variables.

2. Data Preprocessing
   
   2.1 Selection of Inputs: Identify the most relevant features influencing the output.
   
   2.2 Normalization: Scale data (e.g., min-max) to improve learning efficiency.
   
   2.3 Splitting: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

3. Network Architecture Design
   
   3.1 Set the number of input neurons (equal to the number of features).
   
   3.2 Determine the number and size of hidden layers (often determined by trial and error or heuristic rules).
   
   3.3 Choose the number of output neurons (depends on the task).
   
   3.4 Choose activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, tanh).

4. Training the Network
   
   4.1 Define a cost function (e.g., Mean Squared Error for regression, Cross-Entropy for classification).
   
   4.2 Select an optimization algorithm (e.g., Gradient Descent).
   
   4.3 Train the network using backpropagation to update weights by minimizing the cost function.
   
   4.4 Use early stopping, dropout, or regularization to avoid overfitting.

5. Evaluation and Validation: Measure performance using appropriate metrics
   
   5.1 Regression: MSE, MAE, RÂ²
   
   5.2 Classification: Accuracy and Precision

6. Model Deployment
   
   6.1 Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
   
   6.2 Optionally, de-normalize the outputs to return to the original scale.

The synthesis of artificial neural networks is illustrated in the flowchart presented in FigureXX.
