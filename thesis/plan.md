**time series** is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at regular time intervals.

Time Series Components:(Trend Seasonality Cyclic .... )

Types of Time Series: stationary / non-stasionary

A **stationary** time series has constant mean, variance, and autocorrelation over time.

**AR model** predicts future values based on past values of the same series

**Xt​=c+ϕ1​X(t−1)​+ϕ2​X(t−2)​+…+ϕp​X(t−p)​+ϵt​**

Xt: current value

X(t-1): provies value

ϕi​ : coefficients

p: order of the model

c: constant

ϵt​: white noise
