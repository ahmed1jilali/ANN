Great — I’ll perform a full validation of your `fit()` function against the detailed LaTeX equations you provided. I’ll carefully examine each gradient component for weights and biases in both the output and hidden layer, and explain any differences or confirmations.

I’ll get back to you shortly with a breakdown of the match (or mismatch) between your implementation and the theoretical formulas.

# Backpropagation: Theory vs. Implementation

The theoretical formulas given above assume **sigmoid activation** at the output layer, whereas the Python code uses a **linear (identity) output** for regression. In a linear-output model the output activation function $f(z)=z$ has derivative $f'(z)=1$. Thus the error term simplifies and the code’s updates omit the sigmoid‐derivative factor on the output.

- **Output-layer gradients (weights):** The theory states for sigmoid output
  $\frac{\partial E}{\partial w^L} = (a^L - y)\,a^L(1-a^L)\,a^{L-1}.$
  In the code, `delta2 = S2 - y` and `W2_gradients = S1^T @ delta2`. Here $S2=a^L$ and $S1=a^{L-1}$. Since the output is linear, we drop the $a^L(1-a^L)$ factor: effectively $\delta^L = a^L - y$ (instead of $(a^L-y)a^L(1-a^L)$). Thus `W2_gradients = S1^T @ (S2 - y)` matches the form $(a^L - y),a^{L-1}$. In contrast, the given formula includes $a^L(1-a^L)$ because it assumed a sigmoid output.

- **Output-layer gradients (bias):** The theory says
  $\frac{\partial E}{\partial b^L} = (a^L - y)\,a^L(1 - a^L).$
  With a linear output, $\frac{\partial a^L}{\partial b^L}=1$, so $\partial E/\partial b^L = a^L - y$. The code computes `b2_gradients = np.sum(delta2, axis=0) = sum(a^L - y)`, exactly reflecting $\partial E/\partial b^L = a^L - y$ over the batch. (The theoretical expression has an extra $a^L(1-a^L)$ term only if $a^L$ were sigmoid.)

- **Hidden-layer gradients (weights):** The theory gives
  $\frac{\partial E}{\partial w^{L-1}} = (a^L - y)\,a^L(1 - a^L)\,w^L\,a^{L-1}(1 - a^{L-1})\,a^{L-2}.$
  In the code, after computing `delta2 = S2 - y`, the hidden error is
  
  ```
  delta1 = (delta2 @ W2.T) * S1 * (1 - S1)
  W1_gradients = X^T @ delta1
  ```
  
  Here $(\delta2 @ W2.T)$ multiplies by each outgoing weight $w^L$ (propagating the output error back), and `S1*(1-S1)` applies the sigmoid derivative at the hidden layer. This matches the chain rule: hidden error $\delta^{L-1} = (W^L)^T \delta^L \cdot \sigma'(z^{L-1})$. Since $\delta^L = a^L - y$ (no $a^L(1-a^L)$ factor), we get exactly $(a^L - y),w^L,a^{L-1}(1-a^{L-1})$. Then `W1_gradients = X^T @ delta1` multiplies by input $a^{L-2}=X$ to form the full weight gradient, as in theory.

- **Hidden-layer gradients (bias):** The bias gradient is simply the sum of `delta1` over the batch, matching the theoretical $\partial E/\partial b^{L-1} = (a^L - y),a^L(1 - a^L),w^L,a^{L-1}(1 - a^{L-1})$ summed over samples. Again, the code’s `np.sum(delta1)` omits any extra factor at the output.

- **Activation functions per layer:** The key point is that **hidden units use sigmoid**, but **the output is linear**. Therefore only the hidden layer’s gradient includes $\sigma'(S1)=S1(1-S1)$, which we see as `* S1 * (1 - S1)` in `delta1`. There is **no sigmoid derivative on the output**, because linear output has derivative 1. The theoretical formulas given included $a^L(1-a^L)$ under the assumption of sigmoid output.

- **Chain rule correctness:** The code correctly implements the full chain rule. First it computes the output error `delta2 = S2 - y`. Then it propagates this error backward: `delta1 = (delta2 @ W2.T) * S1*(1-S1)` applies the chain rule factor $W^L ,\sigma'(hidden)$. Finally, it computes gradients by pre-multiplying by the layer inputs (`S1.T @ delta2` and `X.T @ delta1`). These steps exactly follow the backpropagation chain-rule decomposition (see for example). In summary, apart from dropping the nonexistent output-sigmoid derivative, the implementation aligns perfectly with the theory.

**Conclusion:** All implemented expressions match the theoretical gradient formulas once we account for the linear output. The only difference is that the code omits the $a^L(1-a^L)$ factors in $\delta^L$ (and hence in $\partial E/\partial w^L$ and $\partial E/\partial b^L$) because $a^L$ is identity. The hidden-layer gradients include the sigmoid derivative as expected. Thus the chain rule is fully and correctly applied in the implementation.

**Sources:** Standard backpropagation derivations (using MSE loss) confirm these formulas. Additionally, references on activation functions note that a linear (identity) output has derivative 1. These support the above correspondence.
